\begin_layout Subsection
Hubbard model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During its 50-year old history the Hubbard model has, despite its simplicity,
 become the most famous model for the study of strongly correlated materials.
 It was introduced by Hubbard, Gutzwiller and Kanamori (citation) in 1963
 for the study of correlated d-electrons in transition metals, showing a
 bahaviour that arises from localization as well as delocalization effects.
 The Hamiltonian in second quantization describes a collection of single
 level atoms associated with Wannier orbitals centered at each site of the
 crystal lattice and is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{Hubbard}=-\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle,\sigma}^{N}v_{ij}d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{j\sigma}+\epsilon_{0}\sum_{i,\sigma}^{N}d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{i\sigma}+U\sum_{i}^{N}d_{i\uparrow}^{\dagger}d_{i\uparrow}d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}d_{i\downarrow},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of lattice sites and the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}[d_{i\sigma}]$
\end_inset

 creates[destroys] an electron with spin 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 at the lattice site with coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}_{i(j)}$
\end_inset

.
 The first term describes the amplitude for an electron to hop between site
 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and its magnitude depends on the overlap between the orbitals.
 The kinetic energy term is diagonalized in a single particle basis of Bloch's
 wavefunctions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\epsilon_{k}=\sum_{j}v_{ij}exp^{ik(R_{i}-R_{j})}
\]

\end_inset

known as a single tight-binding band.
 Since the hopping amplitude decreases strongly with increasing site distance,
 we take only nearest neighbour hopping into account.
 The second term is the on-site energy and the last one the Coulomb repulsion
 of two electrons with opposite spin occupying the same orbital.
 Because the bands are assumed to be strongly localized at the lattice sites,
 electron interactions between different sites are neglected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hubbard Model captures the competition between two key energy scales:
 the kinetic energy and the Coulomb repulsion.
 In the absence of hopping the model reduces to the four atomic states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|\uparrow\right\rangle ,\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with energies 
\begin_inset Formula $0,\epsilon_{0},U+2\epsilon_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 A system at half filling, correspoding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{0}=-\frac{U}{2}$
\end_inset

 , and the limiting cases regarding the Coulomb interaction are often cosidered
 to gain further insight to the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the limit of 
\begin_inset Formula $U\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 the model reduces to a single-band tight-binding model representing a metal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\begin_inset Formula $U\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 the electrons are localizes and the systems becomes a so-called Mott-insulator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crossover between those limits, when the kinetic energy and the Coulomb
 repulsion are competing, opens up a variety of new physical phenomena and
 is essential for the understanding of strongly correlated materials.

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview of equilibrium dynamical mean field theory 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) has become a powerful method when it
 comes to the study of many body systems involving strong electronic correlation
s in as well as out of equilibrium.
 We will start with a brief overview of the DMFT equations in equilibirum
 and extend them to the nonequilibrium analogue in the next chapter.
 The idea of DMFT is to solve the lattice problem with many degrees of freedom
 by mapping it to an impurity problem consisting of a single correlated
 site embedded in an uncorrelated bath, formed by the residual sites of
 the lattice.
 The hybridization between the impurity and the bath is the dynamical mean
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(t,t^{\prime})$
\end_inset

.
 It resembles the exchange of particles with the rest of the lattice and
 must be determined self consistently as a functional of the lattice Greens
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}(t,t^{\prime})$
\end_inset

.
 The key approximation is the local nature of the lattice self energy 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{ij}(t,t')\backsimeq\delta_{ij}\Sigma_{ii}(t,t^{\prime})\label{eq:self-energy-approx}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

that justifies the mapping.

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(t,t')$

\end_inset

 is the self-energy.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since in equilibrium all functions depend only on time-differences, they
 are represented in frequency space by their Fourier transforms.
 As mentioned in the last chapter, the simplest model for the description
 of strongly correlated systems is the single band Hubbard model representing
 a collection of single orbital atoms placed at the nodes of a crystal lattice.
 For a system at half-filling the Hamiltonian reads as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{Hubbard}=-\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle,\sigma}v_{ij}d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}d_{j\sigma}+\sum_{i}U(d_{i\uparrow}^{\dagger}d_{i\uparrow}-\frac{1}{2})(d_{i\downarrow}^{\dagger}d_{i\downarrow}-\frac{1}{2}).
\]

\end_inset

With the approximation that the lattice self energy is local in space the
 local Greens function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{G_{ii}^{\sigma}(t-t^{\prime})=-i\langle\mathcal{T}d_{i\sigma}(t)d_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}(t^{\prime})\rangle},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

 is the time ordering operator, can be computed from an effective impurity
 model described by the action 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{i}=i\int_{c}dtUn_{\uparrow}(t)n_{\downarrow}(t)-i\sum_{\sigma}\int_{c}dtdt^{\prime}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(t)\Delta_{i}(t-t^{\prime})d_{\sigma}(t^{\prime}).\label{eq:DMFT-action}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At time 
\begin_inset Formula $t'$
\end_inset

 an electron hops from the fictious bath to the dot and goes back to the
 bath at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{i}(t-t^{\prime})$
\end_inset

 is the amplitude for this process to happen.
 Whenever two electrons occupy the same site simultaniously this results
 in an energy cost 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, hence the action captures the fluctuation between the four atomic states
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|\uparrow\right\rangle ,\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 It is important to see that DMFT is a mean field only in terms of spacial
 fluctuations, which are freezed, but it takes account of all local temporal
 fluctuations, hence the name

.
 From here on the spin index will be supressed for simplicity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve the impurity problem means to compute the impurity Greens's functions,
 which can be challenging, but still feasible and is considered here in
 Chapter 2.6.
 Once the impurity Green's function is obtained, the impurity self-energy
 is extracted from the Dyson equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{ii}^{-1}(\omega)=\omega+\mu-\Delta_{i}(\omega)-\varSigma_{ii}^{imp}(\omega),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{G}_{0}^{-1}(\omega)=\omega+\mu-\Delta_{i}(\omega)$
\end_inset

 is the non-interacting Green's function, known as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
 The approximation for the self-energy 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is then used to obtain the lattice Greens function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{ij}^{-1}(\omega)=\delta_{ij}[\omega+\mu-\varSigma_{ii}^{imp}(\omega)]-v_{ij}.
\]

\end_inset

In real space this means that all non-local components of the lattice self-energ
y 
\begin_inset Formula $\varSigma_{ij}(\omega)$
\end_inset

 are neglected and the local component corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\varSigma_{ii}^{imp}(\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 For a translationally invariant system (
\begin_inset Formula $\varSigma_{ii}(\omega)\equiv\varSigma(\omega)$
\end_inset

) one averages over the whole Brillouin zone to get the on-site component
 of the lattice Green function, which is referred to as the self-consistency
 condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{ii}(\omega)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k}G_{k}(\omega)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k}\frac{1}{\omega+\mu+\varSigma(\omega)-\epsilon_{k}},
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{k}(\omega)$
\end_inset

 the momentum resolved Greens function, 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 the number of lattice sites and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{k}$
\end_inset

 the dispersion relation of the non-interacting tight binding band 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\epsilon_{k}=\sum_{j}v_{ij}exp^{ik(R_{i}-R_{j})}.
\]

\end_inset

Instead of performing the k-summation one can integrate over the local,
 non-interacting Density of states 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{D(\epsilon)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k}\delta(\epsilon-\epsilon_{k})}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{ii}(\omega)=\int d\epsilon\frac{D(\epsilon)}{\omega+\mu+\varSigma(\omega)-\epsilon}.
\]

\end_inset

The self-consistency condition relates for each frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\omega}$
\end_inset

 the dynamical mean field to the local lattice Green's function.
 This functional relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{G[\Delta]}$
\end_inset

 provides a closed set of equations to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(\omega)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{G(\omega)}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be done by an iterative procedure that does not depend on the
 initial guess for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 In a DMFT cycle the lattice model is mapped onto an auxiliary Anderson
 impurity model (AIM), which is described in Chapter 2.4.
 The methods for solving the auxiliary problem are called impurity solvers,
 a real-time impurity solver based on the strong-coupling expansion is used
 in this thesis.
 With the impurity solver the Green's function and a the self-energy are
 calculated, which are used to update the hybridization function.
 The hybridization function is then used to start a new DMFT-cycle.
 This procedure repeats until a convergence criterium is reached.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzner and Vollhart showed that in the limit of infinite nearest neighbours,
 known as the coordination number Z, DMFT becomes exact if the hopping is
 rescaled properly 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{ij}=\frac{v_{ij}^{*}}{\sqrt{Z}},
\]

\end_inset

with a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}^{*}$
\end_inset

 ensuring that the kinetic energy remains finite and the competition between
 kinetic and potential energy is preserved.
 The approximation for the self-energy 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:self-energy-approx"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 then holds exactly 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{Z\rightarrow\infty}\Sigma_{ij}(t,t^{\prime})=\delta_{ij}\Sigma_{ii}(t,t^{\prime}).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several proofs for this exist including a linked cluster expansion around
 the atomic limit or a cavity method approach.
 Anyways it is quite intuitive that if the number of nearest neighbours
 is very large, spatial fluctuations become negligible.
 Other exact solutions are given in the noninteracting limit (
\begin_inset Formula $U=0$
\end_inset

), where the local lattice Green's function reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ii}(\omega)=\mathcal{G}_{0}^{-1}(\omega)$
\end_inset

, and in the atomic limit 
\begin_inset Formula $(v_{ij}=0)$
\end_inset

, where the system is a collection of disconnected sites.

\begin_layout Subsection
Nonequilibrium DMFT formalism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture non-equilibrium physics in time-dependent systems (e.g.
 an electric-field driven lattice system) all objects within the set of
 DMFT equations need to incorporate the overall temporal evolution of the
 system as well as quantum fluctuations.
 Analogous to the equilibirum case, in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 the self energy is local in space 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Sigma_{ij}(t,t')=\delta_{ij}\Sigma_{i}(t,t^{\prime})
\]

\end_inset

and is used to obtain the contour-ordered lattice Green's function 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}(t,t^{\prime})=-i\langle\mathcal{T}d_{i}(t)d_{j}^{\dagger}(t^{\prime})\rangle$
\end_inset

 from the Dyson equation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{ij}^{-1}(t,t^{\prime})=(G_{0}^{-1})_{ij}(t,t^{\prime})-\delta_{ij}\Sigma_{ii}(t,t^{\prime})
\]

\end_inset

with the non-interacting lattice Green's function 
\begin_inset Formula $(G_{0}^{-1})_{ij}(t,t^{\prime})$
\end_inset

.
 As for an equilibrium system the effective impurity action needs to be
 solved 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{i}=i\int_{c}dtUn_{\uparrow}(t)n_{\downarrow}(t)-i\sum_{\sigma}\int_{c}dtdt^{\prime}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}(t)\Delta_{i}(t,t^{\prime})d_{\sigma}(t^{\prime})
\]

as part of an iterative procedure until the impurity Green's function correspond
s to the local lattice Green's function.
 Besides depending on two times the equations for non-equilibirum DMFT look
 formally identical to the ones presented in the previous chapter.
 The conceptual difference is the non-markovian structure with the self-energy
 as the memory kernel.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was first shown by Georges ans Kotliar in 1992 that the Hubbard model
 in infinite 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{\varepsilon_{\sigma}}$
\end_inset

 are the on-site energy levels and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{U}$
\end_inset

 is the interaction between electrons having opposite spins.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{H_{imp}}$
\end_inset

 can in general incorporate a time-dependence, but for now we will consider
 only time-independent impurity models.
 There are four possible dot eigenstates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|\uparrow\right\rangle ,\left|\downarrow\right\rangle ,\text{\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the dot being empty or occupied by either one or two electrons.
 The non-interacting bath Hamiltonian has the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{B}=\sum_{\sigma,k}\varepsilon_{k}b_{k}^{\dagger}b_{k}

\end_inset

and the coupling between dot and bath is given through the Hybridization
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{hyb}=\sum_{\sigma,k}(v_{\sigma k}b_{k}^{\dagger}d_{\sigma}+v_{\sigma k}^{\ast}d_{\sigma}^{\dagger}b_{k}),
\]

\end_inset

which describes processes in which electrons are hopping from the bath to
 the dot and vice versa.

 This corresponds to a Pierls substitution, which is derived from the requiremen

Dissipative systems

\begin_layout Standard
Real materials can exchange energy and particles with their environment,
 which should be included into the description of our system.
 Continuously driving an open system with an external field enables the
 energy injected into the system to dissipate into the bath and the emergence
 of a steady state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can describe dissipation of energy to other degrees of freedom by coupling
 every site of the lattice to an environment.
 In DMFT two dissipation mechanisms have been adopted so far.
 The first one couples each lattice site to a reservoir of non-interacting
 fermions.

 the impurity.
 Since the bath has a bilinear structure it can be integrated out analytically

 self-energy correction.
 The Dyson equation can be symbolically written as 
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{d}$

 The factor -1 has no physical meaning, but is there to sustain particle-hole
 symmetry for the energy level 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0$

\]

\end_inset

and if we consider that the bath is composed of free harmonic phonon modes
 we can write it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda^{\alpha\alpha}(t-t')=(n_{d}^{(\alpha)}-\delta)^{2}\times\Lambda_{b}(t-t'),$
\end_inset

Working with non-equilibrium systems involves explicit time dependence,

\[
G_{\alpha\alpha}(t,t')=G_{\alpha\alpha}^{(0)}(t,t')-\int_{0}^{t}dt_{1}\int_{0}^{t_{1}}dt_{2}G_{\alpha\alpha}^{(0)}(t,t_{1})\varSigma_{\alpha\alpha}(t_{1},t_{2})G_{\alpha\alpha}(t_{2},t').

Magnetic relaxation in a periodically driven Hubbard model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before exploring new physics, we want to reproduce well known phenomena.
 In their recent research Martin Eckstein and al.
 studied the melting of long-range antiferromagnetic order in a periodically
 driven repulsive Hubbard model.
 This chapter is orientated on their paper and reproduces part of the results.
 We are calculating the dynamics with non-equilibrium DMFT for a Bethe-lattice
 in infinite dimensions.
 First we investigate the melting in the absence of a driving field and
 in a second step we explore the effect of a strong driving field in the
 case of a resonant driving frequency.
 The two quantities we are focusing on are the double occupation

 measuring the formation of charge excitations and the magnetization 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)=\frac{<n_{\uparrow}(t)-n_{\downarrow}(t)>}{1-2d(t)}$
\end_inset

 as an indicator for the antiferromagnetic order of the the system.
 The magnetization 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 is formed by the straggered magnetic order parameter, which is normalizes
 by the probability of a site being sinlgy occupied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Undriven magnetic melting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin with, we will look at the melting mechanisms in different regimes
 in the undriven case (
\begin_inset Formula $A=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v=v$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $_{0}=1)$
\end_inset

.
 In the Mott-insulating regime with a strong Coulomb interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $U\gg v$
\end_inset

, Fig.
 ? shows the magnetic order parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 and the double occupation 
\begin_inset Formula $d(t)$
\end_inset

 for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 during the timeslice 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq v_{0}t\lesssim6$
\end_inset

.
 The dynamics of both entities start with oscillations at short times resulting
 from the Néel state not being an eigenstate of the Hubbard model at finite
 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and change their behavior after 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}t\simeq1$
\end_inset

.
 The formation of charge excitations relaxes fastly to a 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 dependent steady state value at a low rate since the strong Coulomb interaction
 is preventing electrons to hop across the lattice and the magnetization
 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 shows a linear decrease with a U dependent gradient.
 The fast relaxation of the charge dynamics compared to the magnetization
 indicates that the magnetic melting is due to the movement of the charge
 excitations on top of the anti-ferromagnetic spin background.
 To further underpin this statement Eckstein and al.
 investigated the spin precession dynamics by flipping an initially located
 fermion at a single probe site in the x direction.
 An effective magnetic field 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{eff}$
\end_inset

, which is formed by the neighbouring sites, is orientated along the z direction
 leading to harmonic precession of the magnetic moment in the x-y plane.
 It turns out that the precessing magnetic moment sustains, even for times
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}t>1$
\end_inset

, which confirms that the decay of the magnetic order is due to mobile charge
 excitations and local magnetic moments are preserved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Coulomb interaction is lowered, coming close to the non-interacting
 limit 
\begin_inset Formula $U=0$
\end_inset

, one expects quasiparticles to be responsible for the dynamics of the system.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $U\lesssim1$
\end_inset

 the magnetization shows an oscillatory behaviour and decays to zero fastly,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $d(t)$
\end_inset

 relaxes to high values (Fig.
 ?).
 Compared to the results for 
\begin_inset Formula $U\gg v$
\end_inset

, where the spin dynamics relax much slower than the charge dynamics, here
 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d(t)$
\end_inset

 both relax around 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}t\simeq1$
\end_inset

, indicating that the destruction of the anti ferromagnetic order is caused
 by the destruction of local magnetic moments.

Magnetic melting in resonant driven lattices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Martin Eckstein and al are exploring the effects of an electric driving
 field in three different regimes: the high frequency, the resonant and
 in gap away from resonant driving regime.
 In this chapter we will focus only on the case of resonant driving, which
 modifies the behaviour of 
\begin_inset Formula $M(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d(t)$
\end_inset

 strongly, changing the magnetization from a slow decay in the absence of
 driving to a fast decay even for small driving amplitudes.
 The double occupation goes from a saturation at low values to high values
 resembling the case for 
\begin_inset Formula $U\lesssim1$
\end_inset

.
 Resonant driving is a tool to switch from the charge-excitation to the
 quasiparticle melting mechanism and control the relaxation speed of the
 charge and spin dynamics.

Energy dissipation in a periodically driven system

We want to investigate how the system's response to a small pertubation
 changes when it is driven out of equilibrium.
 The response 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\omega_{probe}}(A_{probe})$

 is defined as the energy current derivative with respect to the probe amplitude
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{probe}(\omega_{probe})$
\end_inset

\[
P_{\omega_{probe}}(A_{probe})=\lim_{A_{probe}\rightarrow0}\frac{dI_{E}(A_{probe}(\omega_{probe}))}{dA_{probe}(\omega_{probe})}\simeq\frac{I_{E}(\Delta A_{probe}(\omega_{probe}))}{\Delta A_{probe}(\omega_{probe})}=\frac{I_{E}(A_{probe}(\omega_{probe}))-I_{E}(A_{probe=0}(\omega_{probe}))}{A_{probe}(\omega_{probe})-A_{probe=0}(\omega_{probe})}.

Resonant driving at intermediate U 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start discussing results for a Coulomb interaction of 
\begin_inset Formula $U=5$
\end_inset

 while the system is exposed to an electric field with the frequency of
 the bandgap and various amplitudes.
 During the whole simulation energy can dissipate into a fermion bath, with
 a flat desity of states as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "flat-density-of-states"

\end_inset

 and the coupling strength 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 Going to a finite 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 after the system was initially in a zero-temperature anti-ferromagnetic
 state with 
\begin_inset Formula $U\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a strong quench in the Coulomb interaction.
 The external bath functions not only as a dissipation mechanism so that
 a steady state can emerge, it also fixes the temperature of the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the spectral function without driving 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "A_resonant_pumping"

\end_inset

 shows an upper and lower Hubbard band for high temperatures and the formation
 of low frequency excitations for 
\begin_inset Formula $T\leq0.2$
\end_inset

, an indicator for Kondo physics.
 We can estimate the Kondo temperature over the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T_{K}=U\sqrt{\frac{\Gamma}{2U}}\exp^{-\frac{\pi U}{8\Gamma}+\frac{\pi\Gamma}{2U}}$
\end_inset

, which results in 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T_{K}=0.16$
\end_inset

.
 Increasing the amplitude of the driving field effectively increases the
 temperature and therefore leads to the destruction of the Kondo peak.
 A resonant driving field pumps electrons/holes between the lower/upper
 Hubbard band and accelerates the equilibration of the system, for 
\begin_inset Formula $A=1.0$
\end_inset

 the spectral functions are all symmetric and temperature independent except
 the leftovers of a small Kondo peak.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probing at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference between th
 side bands and the Kondo peak (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{probe}=2.5$
\end_inset

 ) shows a small response for 
\begin_inset Formula $A=0$
\end_inset

 and goes to negative values for 
\begin_inset Formula $A\geq0.5$
\end_inset

, which can be interpreted as an energy flow from the bath into the system.
 Probing at the same frequency as we are pumping shows that the response
 first increases as we would expect from the evolution of the spectral functions
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "A_resonant_pumping"

\end_inset

.
 This trend changes at the treshold value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A=1.0$
\end_inset

 and the response starts to decrease again until the response of the highest
 pump amplitude reaches the same scale as the response without a driving
 field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also surprising that there is almost no temperature dependance seen
 in the response functions, especially for small pump amplitudes.
 Obviously the response carries information, which is not contained in the
 single-particle Greens functions we are calculating.
