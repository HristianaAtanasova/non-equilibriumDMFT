All calculations are done by computing the propagators for the upper and lower branch explicitly. 
In the previous version the bold propagators on the lower branch were simply the complex conjugated of the ones on the upper branch. This is theoretically correct, but numerically it makes a difference, since the vertex functions K are not exactly the complex conjugated for reversed times.
